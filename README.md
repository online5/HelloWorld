This program is just to learn git.
Hello there people, i am learning to code(mostly webappliations).
At current stage my development skills are quite weak, but i am dedicated to work on them to become demanded software developer.
There were many ups and downs(ok mostly downs), but this wont't stop me from achieving my goals.
